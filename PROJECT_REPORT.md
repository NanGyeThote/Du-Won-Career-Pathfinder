## System Workflow

### User Interaction Flows

#### 1. Career Quiz Workflow
```
User Input → Quiz Component → Backend Processing → ML Prediction → RAG Enhancement → Response Display
```

**Detailed Steps:**
1. User completes interactive career assessment
2. Frontend determines quiz type (CS-specific or general)
3. Data sent to appropriate backend endpoint (`/api/career-quiz/cs` or `/api/career-quiz`)
4. Backend processes answers through ML models for career prediction
5. RAG chain retrieves relevant career information from knowledge base
6. Personalized recommendations generated and returned
7. Results displayed with source documents and actionable advice

#### 2. CV Analysis Workflow
```
PDF Upload → Text Extraction → Keyword Analysis → RAG Processing → Career Recommendations
```

**Detailed Steps:**
1. User uploads PDF resume/CV
2. Backend extracts text using PyPDF library (cached for performance)
3. spaCy processes text to extract key skills and terms
4. Keywords used to query RAG chain for relevant career information
5. AI generates personalized career analysis and recommendations
6. Results include skill gap analysis and career path suggestions

#### 3. Conversational AI Workflow
```
User Message → Language Detection → RAG Retrieval → LLM Generation → Streaming Response
```

**Detailed Steps:**
1. User inputs text or voice message
2. Voice input processed through Whisper speech-to-text
3. Language detection for potential translation needs
4. Message context enhanced with quiz data if available
5. RAG chain retrieves relevant context from knowledge base
6. Custom Mistral model generates streaming response
7. Real-time token-by-token delivery to frontend

#### 4. Knowledge Base Generation Workflow
```
Topic Selection → Wikipedia Search → Content Processing → Vector Embedding → RAG Chain Creation
```

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Developer/admin defines topics and sections
2. Wikipedia API searches for relevant articles
3. Content extracted and processed in parallel
4. Documents chunked and embedded using Ollama
5. Temporary ChromaDB instance created
6. RAG chain configured for testing
7. Interactive testing interface with voice input support

### Data Flow Architecture

#### Request Processing Pipeline
1. **Frontend**: User interaction captured and validated
2. **API Gateway**: FastAPI routes request to appropriate service
3. **Service Layer**: Business logic processing and model invocation
4. **Data Layer**: Vector search, ML prediction, or knowledge retrieval
5. **Response Generation**: AI model generates response
6. **Streaming Delivery**: Real-time response delivery to frontend

#### Caching Strategy
- **LRU Cache**: PDF text extraction with file hash-based caching
- **In-Memory Cache**: Career quiz and CV analysis results
- **Model Cache**: Loaded ML models and embeddings
- **Vector Cache**: ChromaDB for efficient similarity search
